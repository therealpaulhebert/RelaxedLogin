## Synopsis

This project is a Spring Boot Web / Security based web app. It uses Mustache as the view templating engine, with Bootstrap for styling, and jQuery for some UI slickness. The User login is based in CouchDb's

## Motivation

I couldn't find a full example of Spring Boot and Mustache. I had some trouble getting it to work until I found a website where the extension for the view files was .mustache. Then I wanted to use CouchDb to host the data and login info. I found the built in user database to be pretty cool!
